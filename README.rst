pylttb: perform downsampling of a series using Largest Triangle Threebuckets algorithm
======================================================================================
|License: MIT|

**pylttb** is an efficient implementation of Largest Triangle Threebuckets algorithm.

The algorithm was described by Sveinn Steinarsson in his master thesis. More info and original
implementation can be found at `this page_`. The code in **pylttb** is based on this implementation
but structures computations a bit differently to leverage `numpy` 's array arithmetics.
